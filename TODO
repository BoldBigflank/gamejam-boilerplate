build chain
===========
- ? replace all the global variables by arguments with default value of the IIFE (e.g. const foo = 'bar' => (foo = 'bar') => { ... })
- ? mangle properties, and use cache names to replace all values matching an object propery that are assigned to a variable (e.g. hero.move = [], action = 'move' becomes a.b = [], c = 'move'... 'move' needs to be converted to 'b')
